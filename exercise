The terminal is a way to push codes into GitHub, or to navigate through your computer in faster ways. I see the terminal as something with many possibilities.

Git is a version control system and GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service 

We use Github for group projects so people can do what they gotta do and push it into Github.
